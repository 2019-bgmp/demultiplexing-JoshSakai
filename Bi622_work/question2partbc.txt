
Given that we have a high quality mean set of bases, the cutoff point should be just below the lowest mean to include
as much quality data as possible. The reason why I've decided this is to make sure there isn't a significant difference in the Number
of read cutoffs made at the beginning of the line as opposed to the end.

For the reads themselves cutoff = Q30
for the indexes cutoff = Q25

R2 has 3976613 indexes with N's
R3 has 3328051 indexes with N's
